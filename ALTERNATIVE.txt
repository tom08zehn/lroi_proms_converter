ETL tools with GUI

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a critical data integration process that extracts data from various source systems, transforms it to meet business rules, and loads it into a target destination like a data warehouse. It serves as a vital tool for data migration by ensuring data is cleaned, formatted, and moved efficiently.

Examples: Talend Open Studio (EOL, end of life)
Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle, outdated)
or Apache Hop (modern, more lightweight)

Java based, can run using Java portable or as Docker container.


The Hop Orchestration Platform, or Apache Hop, aims to facilitate all aspects of data and metadata orchestration.

Hop is an entirely new open source data integration platform that is easy to use, fast and flexible

Hop aims to be the future of data integration. Visual development enables developers to be more productive than they can be through code. Our Design once, run anywhere workflows and pipelines can be designed in the Hop Gui and run on the Hop native engine (local or remote), or on Spark, Flink, Google Dataflow or AWS EMR through Beam. Lifecycle Management enables developers and administrators to switch between projects, environments and purposes without leaving your train of thought.
